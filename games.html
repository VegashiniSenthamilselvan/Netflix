        <p><b>Game of Thrones</b>, American fantasy television series created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, based on the Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.R. Martin. The HBO series ran for eight seasons between 2011 and 2019 and became one of the most acclaimed programs of all time. A critical darling and cultural phenomenon, the series had a profound effect on American television and the fantasy genre because of its complex characters, its focus on political intrigue, and its dark, even bleak, approach.</p>
        <h2>Premise and plot</h2>
        <p>Game of Thrones follows a large cast of characters and interwoven story arcs. It is primarily set on the fictional continent of Westeros, which is divided into the Seven Kingdoms and the lands in the far North beyond “the Wall,” an enormous wall of fortified ice. The Seven Kingdoms is a realm composed of seven once independent kingdoms that have been, to greater or lesser degrees, unified under a single monarch, who sits on the Iron Throne. The planet on which Westeros is found has seasons of variable lengths, with summers and winters often lasting for many years.</p>
        <p>The series focuses on several noble houses of Westeros and a complicated, multiparty war for the Iron Throne that features shifting conflicts, alliances, and betrayals. Key houses include the Starks, who rule in the North; the Lannisters, a wealthy family from the West who have married into the royal line; the Baratheons, who at the outset hold the Iron Throne; and the Targaryens, who once controlled the Iron Throne using dragons but who have been nearly wiped out by the time the story begins.</p>
        <p>This war develops after the death of King Robert Baratheon (played by Mark Addy) and the resulting feud between his friend and ally Lord Eddard (“Ned”) Stark (Sean Bean) and Robert’s widow, Queen Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), and her children. The conflict draws in two of the Stark children, Robb (Richard Madden) and Sansa (Sophie Turner), while the younger children Arya (Maisie Williams) and Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) find themselves on their own terrifying adventures. Jon Snow (Kit Harington), raised as a bastard member of the Stark family, serves in the Night’s Watch, a military organization that defends the Seven Kingdoms from forces beyond the Wall. Cersei’s brothers Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) also play key roles. Exiled on the continent of Essos, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) seeks to return to Westeros with dragons and an army in order to reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen.</p>

        <h2>Reception and cultural impact</h2>
        <p>Season one of Game of Thrones premiered to positive critical reaction, which cited the rich and complex storytelling, sensational production values, and stellar cast. This acclaim became almost universal in subsequent seasons, as the show both found its feet creatively and became a cultural phenomenon. Game of Thrones won more Emmy nominations and awards than any other drama series in Emmy history. In all, it garnered 159 Emmy Award nominations and 59 wins, including 4 wins for outstanding drama series and Dinklage’s 4 wins for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series.</p>
        <p><b>Ratings for the series </b>grew throughout its run, and the final season reached an average of 46 million viewers per episode. The intense popularity of the show along with its fantasy iconography made it a merchandising juggernaut, with some estimates putting its merchandising revenue at upward of $2 billion. Names from Game of Thrones—including Daenerys, Khaleesi, Arya, Lyanna, Brienne, and Renly—became popular for babies born during the show’s run. The show’s popularity also generated scholarly interest in the fantasy genre and the medieval period that had inspired it, evidenced by the appearance of college classes dedicated to examining the show, the books, and their inspirations. Despite its popularity, the show has been criticized for its extreme and graphic violence, especially its portrayal of sexual violence. Numerous major women characters are the victims of rape or attempted rape, a plot device that many have denounced as gratuitous and exploitative.</p>
        <p>Despite its large viewership, the final season of Game of Thrones was less beloved by critics and audiences than the show’s earlier seasons. Critical reaction and audience ratings began to waver slightly in season five, at which point the show had begun to run out of material from Martin’s unfinished book series to adapt, but generally remained strong. Season eight, however, was widely criticized as rushed, sacrificing story and character arcs for a focus on massive set pieces. The series finale was especially controversial and unsatisfying for many viewers.</p>
        <p>Though ending on a low note hurt the legacy of the series for some, a spin-off series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022 and was both critically and commercially successful.</p>
